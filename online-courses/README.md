There is a lot out there to learn with. If you have a language or a technology you want to learn more about, have a look around one of the MOOCs or self-paced courses listed below. They all have search systems so you can quickly find what you are interested in. Simple tutorials for using Git for version control are available at the top as well.

If you don't see something you're looking for or have something you'd like to add, please contact us directly [via email](acm.of.mcneese@gmail.com) or [check out how you can contribute to this repository yourself]().

## General Software Dev Resources
--------
* Git Tutorials (Version Control)
  * [Udacity - A Beginnerâ€™s Git and GitHub Tutorial](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html)
  * [Github Interactive Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
  * [Git Reference Guide](http://gitref.org/) (A little more in-depth and advanced)
  * [Git Internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals) (Very in-depth. You may want some experience with git first)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
  * Codecademy is pretty great for learning the basic syntax of languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript (as well as React, Angular, and Node), PHP, and some basic database and command line knowledge--Not a bad place to start for a beginner.

## MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses)
--------
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
  * Coursera is a platform which offers **free scheduled courses** over the course of the year in a wide variety of disciplines. Programming is the most popular category on there, but there are many others.
  * You can join any course **for free** as an "auditor" and get _all_ the lessons included with it (all you really need), or if you choose to pursue a certificate you can pay their fee and get your assignments graded by the instructor as you take the class in real time.
  * Certificates _do not get you college credits_, but they can look good on your resume if you choose to get them.
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
  * Udacity is a little more self-paced in that you can join **many free courses** at any point in time.
  * These courses are taught by big name companies such as Google and Facebook as well as prestigious colleges (same with Coursera above).
* [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=engineering&subcat=computerscience)
  * MIT makes the content of a lot of its courses, especially CSCI ones, available online for free to the whole world. This includes classes on Algorithms, Databases, and much more. The link above is filtered to computer science topics only, but it's easy to find more on that same page.
