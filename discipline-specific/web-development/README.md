# Web Development
--------

Web applications development is the _wild west_ of software right now.
There are a wide variety of competing languages and frameworks which dominate this space.

**Javascript** has Node, Express, AngularJS, ReactJS, MEAN Stack...

**PHP** has the LAMP Stack, CodeIgniter, Composer...

**Python** has Django, Flask, Bottle, Pyramid...

**Ruby** and Ruby on Rails dominate quick application prototyping and deployment...

You're probably thinking: "I know these languages exist, but what is a 'Stack'? Why are there so many options? How does deployment even work?"

Start with the basics. Take it slow, and it'll all come as you gain experience.

> #### Note: A lot of these tutorials require some form of `Web Hosting` service to get a website or app up and running. We heavily recommend `Amazon Web Services`' **free-tier** account with which you can create a simple, low-power, private server which you can install software on, interact with via FTP, and build your web app on your own platform. **[Here's where you can get started with that!](https://aws.amazon.com/start-now/)**

# Starter Tutorials

## Javascript
--------

**[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a fantastic repository of knowledge based around Open-Source-Software.**

* **[MDN's Javascript Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** cover everything from basic to advanced `Javascript`. **It is also a fantastic reference to use for any questions you may have about how the language works.**
* **[MDN's Getting Started with the Web Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)** Takes you through building a simple, hosted site using `HTM`L, `CSS`, and `Javascript`, though in relation to publishing the site it is up to the developer to decide--but they give you a lot of leads to find something that works. _(See Amazon Web Services note above)_

**jQuery is a library written for Javascript in the Web Browser. It makes manipulating the Document-Object Model (DOM) very fast and efficient.**

* **[jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/)**
 * Covers, well, the fundamentals of javascript with jQuery.
 * Traverse the DOM
 * Work with events and AJAX

# Frameworks
--------

Up top, aside from the "Stack"s, these other names are what are called **frameworks**. Frameworks are large libraries which abstract away and deal with a large number of functions which are required for making web apps.

These frameworks lay the foundation which makes building apps easy. All the heavy lifting like file input/output, serializing objects, interacting with databases, and more are **already written for you to use**.

**You just have to learn how to use the frameworks to build what you want.** That's the beauty of it.

> Keep in mind not to forget that this is all built on software you or I could write, and is prone to errors and will need debugging from time to time. **It is always important to remember the basics of programming and architecture.**

**Frameworks. Are. Not. Magic.**

### NodeJS
--------
> Okay, so NodeJS is actually more of an environment for Javascript than a framework. Fact of the matter is, NodeJS is the backbone of most other frameworks out there. AngularJS, React, Backbone, EmberJS...all use node on some level, or at least the Node Package Manager, otherwise known as `npm`.

* **[Felix's Node.js Beginner's Guide](http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html)**
  * Felix gets you through installing NodeJS as well as building a simple server and module.
  * Pretty good place to start.
* **[Build a RESTful API Using Node and Express 4](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4)**
  * Shows you how to build an  API (Application Programming Interface) that is [RESTful](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming) in nature
  * Express is what the majority of backend developers use for NodeJS applications.
  * Express makes serving up pages, JSON, and more very easy by tying it to "routes", which are based on the URL structure of the web app.
* **[Getting Started with NPM - Official](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)**
  * This is a pretty detailed introduction to using the Node Package Manager
  * Going forward with Javascript web development, this is going to be used everywhere.
* **[Interactive package.json Cheat Sheet](http://browsenpm.org/package.json)**
  * This file is how you configure dependencies and building of a NodeJS package on a basic level.
  * This interactive cheat sheet can come in handy!

### AngularJS
--------
AngularJS is a frontend framework which breaks everything down into `components` which make up a web application. It is maintained by `Google`, and is a staple in many, many modern web applications.

* **[The Official AngularJS 1 Tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial)** is a great place to start. You build a simple application while learning all the fundamentals of AngularJS applications.
* **[The Official AngularJS 2 Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/index.html)**, **Tour of Heroes**, builds an application with `Microsoft`'s preferred Javascript variant, `Typescript`. **This is a tutorial reserved for more intermediate users of Javascript** who are familiar with things like `npm`, `Grunt`, `Babel`, and are interested in a more reliable and testable variation on the popular web language.
