# Web Development
--------

Web applications development is the _wild west_ of software right now.
There are a wide variety of competing languages and frameworks which dominate this space.

**Javascript** has Node, Express, AngularJS, ReactJS, MEAN Stack...

**PHP** has the LAMP Stack, CodeIgniter, Composer...

**Python** has Django, Flask, Bottle, Pyramid...

**Ruby** and Ruby on Rails dominate quick application prototyping and deployment...

You're probably thinking: "I know these languages exist, but what is a 'Stack'? Why are there so many options? How does deployment even work?"

Start with the basics. Forget frameworks. Forget deploying and scaling. Forget the literal sea of Javascript options.

> Note: A lot of these tutorials require some form of `Web Hosting` service to get a website or app up and running. We heavily recommend `Amazon Web Services`' **free-tier** account with which you can create a simple, low-power, private server which you can install software on, interact with via FTP, and build your web app on your own platform. **[Here's where you can get started with that!](https://aws.amazon.com/start-now/)**

## Starter Tutorials
--------

### Javascript
--------

**[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a fantastic repository of knowledge based around Open-Source-Software.**

* **[MDN's Javascript Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** cover everything from basic to advanced Javascript. It is also a fantastic reference to use for any questions you may have about how the language works.
* **[MDN's Getting Started with the Web Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)** Takes you through building a simple, hosted site using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, though in relation to publishing the site it is up to the developer to decide--but they give you a lot of leads to find something that works. (See Amazon Web Services note above)


### PHP
--------
(To be written soon!)



## Frameworks
--------

Up top, aside from the "Stack"s, these other names are what are called **frameworks**. Frameworks are large libraries which abstract away and deal with a large number of functions which are required for making web apps.

These frameworks lay the foundation which makes building apps easy. All the heavy lifting like file input/output, serializing objects, interacting with databases, and more are **already written for you to use**.

**You just have to learn how to use the frameworks to build what you want.** That's the beauty of it.

> Keep in mind not to forget that this is all built on software you or I could write, and is prone to errors and will need debugging from time to time. **It is always important to remember the basics of programming and architecture.**

**Frameworks. Are. Not. Magic.**

### AngularJS
--------
AngularJS is a frontend framework which breaks everything down into `components` which make up a web application. It is maintained by `Google`, and is a staple in many, many modern web applications.

* **[The Official AngularJS 1 Tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial)** is a great place to start. You build a simple application while learning all the fundamentals of AngularJS applications.
* **[The Official AngularJS 2 Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/index.html)**, **Tour of Heroes**, builds an application with `Microsoft`'s preferred Javascript variant, Typescript. **This is a tutorial reserved for more intermediate users of Javascript** who are familiar with things like `npm`, `Grunt`, `Babel`, and are interested in a more reliable and testable variation on the popular web language.
