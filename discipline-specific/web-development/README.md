# Web Development
--------

Web applications development is the _wild west_ of software right now.
There are a wide variety of competing languages and frameworks which dominate this space.

**Javascript** has Node, Express, AngularJS, ReactJS, MEAN Stack...

**PHP** has the LAMP Stack, CodeIgniter, Composer...
**Python** has Django, Flask, Bottle, Pyramid...
**Ruby** and Ruby on Rails dominate quick application prototyping and deployment...

You're probably thinking: "I know these languages exist, but what is a 'Stack'? Why are there so many options? How does deployment even work?"

Aside from the "Stack"s, these other names are **frameworks**. Frameworks are large libraries which abstract away and deal with a large number of functions which are required for making web apps.

These frameworks lay the foundation which makes building apps easy. All the heavy lifting like file input/output, serializing objects, interacting with databases, and more are **already written for you to use**.

**You just have to learn how to use the frameworks to build what you want.** That's the beauty of it.

Now, a framework builds your application front-end or back-end.

The **front-end** is what happens on an application user's browser, be it on a personal computer or a mobile device. This is called the **Client**.

The **back-end** is what happens on a remote server, which the Client interacts with. This is called, well, the **Server**.

The technologies which make up the front and back end together are known as the **Stack**. It's why you often see developers who do both front-end and back-end work referred to as **Full-Stack Developers**.

The tutorials and articles linked here will refer to front-end and back-end frameworks which you can use to build a "full" stack. I.E.: A working web app. Some tutorials linked will demonstrate how to deploy an application, whereas some may detail how to merely build the front or back of one.

**All of these will be via free services and tutorials**, so feel no hesitation in jumping right in to something that sounds interesting to you!
