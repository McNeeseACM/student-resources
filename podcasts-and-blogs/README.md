One great way to learn more about computer science is to engage in discussion with others in the field!

The second best option to this is to **_listen to other people talk about it_**.

Podcasts are great for while you're driving, relaxing, working out, or engaging in any sort of mind-free activity. (I.E.: Not in class)

Here are some great ones:

* **[Code Newbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast)**
  * **This is a fantastic podcast for beginners** in that every topic is targeted to someone just starting out computer science or software dev.
  * Code Newbie brings in guests who are both in the field and just starting out--that way you either learn about how someone does something or how someone learned to do something.
  * One really cool thing is the diversity of the guests. A lot of these guests are either from another discipline or faced some variety of adversity in getting into computer science, and found their way to learning and working successfully. **If you're looking for motivation, this is a great place to look.**

* **[Hansel Minutes](http://hanselminutes.com/)**
  * This podcast covers a _very_ wide variety of topics in programming and computer science.
  * The host brings on someone to interview from an interesting niche or with an interesting project, and he approaches from a point of ignorance--asking all the right questions that anyone unfamiliar with the topic would. **This makes all the episodes very approachable and easy to digest.**
