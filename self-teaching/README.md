There is a lot out there to learn with. If you have a language or a technology you want to learn more about, have a look around one of the MOOCs or self-paced courses listed below. They all have search systems so you can quickly find what you are interested in. Simple tutorials for using Git for version control are available at the top as well.

If you don't see something you're looking for or have something you'd like to add, please contact us directly [via email](acm.of.mcneese@gmail.com) or [check out how you can contribute to this repository yourself]().

#### If you're looking to practice with a specific language you already know, please head over to our [Programming Practice Resources](https://github.com/McNeeseACM/student-resources/tree/master/programming-practice). These courses and tutorials are far more general in scope.

## General Software Dev Resources
--------
* Git Tutorials (Version Control)
  * [Udacity - A Beginnerâ€™s Git and GitHub Tutorial](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html)
  * [Github Interactive Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
  * [Git Reference Guide](http://gitref.org/) (A little more in-depth and advanced)
  * [Git Internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals) (Very in-depth. You may want some experience with git first)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
  * Codecademy is pretty great for learning the basic syntax of languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript (as well as React, Angular, and Node), PHP, and some basic database and command line knowledge--Not a bad place to start for a beginner.

## MOOCs (Massive Online Open Courses)
--------
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
  * Coursera is a platform which offers **free scheduled courses** over the course of the year in a wide variety of disciplines. Programming is the most popular category on there, but there are many others.
  * You can join any course **for free** as an "auditor" and get _all_ the lessons included with it (all you really need), or if you choose to pursue a certificate you can pay their fee and get your assignments graded by the instructor as you take the class in real time.
  * Certificates _do not get you college credits_, but they can look good on your resume if you choose to get them.
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
  * Udacity is a little more self-paced in that you can join **many free courses** at any point in time.
  * These courses are taught by big name companies such as Google and Facebook as well as prestigious colleges (same with Coursera above).
* [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=engineering&subcat=computerscience)
  * MIT makes the content of a lot of its courses, especially CSCI ones, available online for free to the whole world. This includes classes on Algorithms, Databases, and much more. The link above is filtered to computer science topics only, but it's easy to find more on that same page.

## Self-paced Courses
--------
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)
  * This is a favorite of a lot of web developers who started out very new to programming.
  * Begin with simple HTML, CSS, and Javascript and slowly work your way towards building web applications and helping a non-profit organization build out their own application.
  * This covers basic programming, algorithms, version control, web development with frameworks, application deployment, everything. It is _really_ comprehensive and **totally free**.
* [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)
  * This focuses on web development using Ruby on Rails, a popular web framework for the scripting language, Ruby.
  * Ruby on Rails is used in a lot of large scale web applications (Airbnb, Github, Hulu, and many more).
  * The curriculum is massive and extensive, but as with all of these you can go at your own pace outside of classes and work.
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
  * This is an easy introduction, even approachable by non-programmers, that starts from the very basics.
  * An actually un-boring but really exciting exploration of using the scripting language Python to automate all kinds of tasks from spread sheet manipulation to web-crawling.
  * Python is incredibly easy to pick up and start playing around with, and it is an incredibly powerful language if you get really into it (even used by data scientists for machine learning).
