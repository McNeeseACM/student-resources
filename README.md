# MSU ACM Student Resources
--------

### **Where do I go from Here?**
--------
This is the question we all ask ourselves starting out in Computer Science.

Ours is the newest, most diverse discipline in the world and every month it seems like there's new technology, frameworks, programming languages, and more. It can be really intimidating--especially just starting out with minimal training in C and Java. **It's perfectly normal to not know what you want out of it at this point.**

That doesn't mean you're behind. It just means that it all starts for you, here and now.

It is our sincere hope that you find something here to help you on your journey to finding what you want to do with computer science.

There are some links below to collections of external links to plenty of resources, with more being added in time by our own students and alumni.

If you have any questions. [Email us directly](acm.of.mcneese@gmail.com), or feel free to [submit an issue to this repository.](https://github.com/McNeeseACM/student-resources/issues/new)

### _Resources for Use by Students for Self Learning, Practice, and Contributing_
--------

Quick Links:
* [Student Programming Resources](https://github.com/McNeeseACM/student-resources/tree/master/competitive-programming)
  * This contains websites whose content is related to algorithms programming, competitive coding, and general programming exercises. 
* [Self-teaching Resources](https://github.com/McNeeseACM/student-resources/tree/master/online-courses)
  * This is an expanding compendium of tutorial sites for all purposes. Version control, Web Frameworks, Database Management, Free Online Courses, Language Specific Resources, etc.
* [Open Source Contribution Resources](https://github.com/McNeeseACM/student-resources/tree/master/open-source-contribution)
  * This contains links to websites dedicated to helping new programmers become acclimated to software development in the open world and getting a developer to a point where they are confident enough to contribute to Open Source Software.
* [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/McNeeseACM/student-resources/tree/master/FAQ)
  * As questions are asked or issues arise, this will be filled with the most repeated of them. If you have a simple question, look here first!

### On Academic and Professional Integrity
--------
We of the ACM at McNeese, as an organization at a scholarly institution, adhere to our institution's [academic integrity policy.](https://www.mcneese.edu/policy/academic_integrity_policy) Via this, we do not permit the following, and will not hesitate to reject or delete content which we deem to not be in line with this policy or our standards:
  * **We do not condone plagiarism or submitting another person's work in your own name.**
  * **We do not condone the sharing of grade-sensitive class materials (tests and quizzes) amongst classmates unless explicitly distributed by the teacher in charge of the class.** Homework and notes are acceptable things to share. It is good to assist others, but you are not helping someone by denying them a true test of their progress in their coursework or career.

As well as adhering to McNeese's policies, we recognize that as a subsidiary chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery we must uphold and extoll the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct) as well. As software developers we have an incredible impact on the world around us, and that is a heavy responsibility. The scope of this code is very large, but the following issues are common and also not permissible via ACM chapter channels:
  * **Distributing software, textbooks, and other resources not within the public domain.** I.E.: Pirating resources which would otherwise require payment for use. There are plenty of free resources out there for most purposes. Software products and products of academia that cost money pay for the livelihood of software developers and scholars just like you.
  * **Manipulating, exploiting, or otherwise meddling with school software and hardware resources in ways not intended or stipulated by school staff.** If you download software onto a school computer, place malicious files on school computers, or tamper with data you shouldn't be tampering with, you are in direct violation of not only ACM ethics, but campus policy. We will not hesitate to report any individuals caught doing so.

### Contributing to Resources
--------
You want to add something to this? Awesome!
The more resources our students have, the better.

This functions just as any other repository on github, and therefore any changes one wishes to make are submitted via a `Pull Request`. Our [Pull Request Tutorial]() uses changes to this repository as an example, so you can check that out to see how you can contribute!
