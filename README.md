### Contributing to Resources
--------
You want to add something to this? Awesome!
The more resources our students have, the better.

This functions just as any other repository on github, and therefore any changes one wishes to make are submitted via a `Pull Request`. Our [Pull Request Tutorial]() uses changes to this repository as an example, so you can check that out to see how you can contribute!
