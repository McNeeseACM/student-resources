## What is the ACM?
--------
.

* **As a National, Professional Organization:** (from ACM website)
  * ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges.
  * As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence.
  * ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and professional networking.

.

* **As a Chapter here at McNeese:**
  * As a local chapter, the **McNeese ACM**'s goals are the exact same.
  * We wish to provide opportunities for the students here at McNeese to:
    * **Expand upon their learning** outside of the classroom.
    * **Network with other students and alumni**.
    * Compete in **local and national programming competitions**.
    * **Find engaging career opportunities** (Internships, Co-op Positions, Open Source Software (OSS) Projects).
    * **Find out what they want out of their education and career--or what they want their career to be!**
    
## What does the McNeese ACM chapter do?
--------
.

* **Bi-Weekly Student Meetings**
  * **Thursday, 5:30pm, every other week, starting September 8th!**
  * Meet and network with classmates!
  * **In the Hackerspace** (Behind Drew Hall).
  * Formally run meeting, with **free food**
  * Come out and ask us anything! **We are here to help you!** (open forum for questions follows meeting and precedes workshop)
  * **_Student-led_ workshop after every meeting!**
  * _New workshop topic every meeting_
  * **First workshop Topic (September 8th): Starting Out with Competitive Algorithms Programming**
    * Open to students of all experience levels!!

.

* **Annual Programming Competitions**
  * **Open to all levels of programmer.**
  * **"You don't know what you don't know until you know you don't know it." - Anonymous**
  * Really great way to expose yourself to challenging, different programming.
  * **ACM Inter-Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC)**
    * Hosted every fall by Region (ours includes LSU, Alabama, etc)
    * Focuses on lower-level imperative languages such as `C`, `C++`, `Java`
    * Teams of up to 3 members
  * **IEEEXtreme 24-Hour Programming Marathon**
    * Hosted every fall _locally at McNeese_
    * 24-hour-long competition, wide variety of problems of all experience levels
    * Features very wide variety of languages (`Javascript`, `Ruby`, `Python`, `Scala`, and many others...)
    * Teams of up to 3 members
    
.

* **Social Opportunities**
  * **Student Tailgate at every home football game**, joint-hosted with the IEEE (Electrical Engineering Society)
  * Social Nights to come:
    * **ACM will be working with other student organizations to host open gaming and movie nights!**
    * Board games, Video Games (Super Smash Brothers, FIFA, and more), and more! (and more!)
    * Will be hosted **on campus**, locations announced as events come up (and at preceding ACM meetings, so come down)!
  
.
  
* **Student Philanthropy and Outreach**
  * McNeese ACM has historically taken part in both **[Hour of Code](https://code.org/learn)** and **McNeese's own E-Week**, which reach out to young students in elementary school, Jr High and High School to introduce them to Software, Hardware, and other STEM opportunities.
  * **This Spring, McNeese ACM will be working towards hosting a [Child's Play](http://childsplaycharity.org/) Gaming Marathon.**
    * Child's play brings games to children in hospitals with terminal illnesses to bring joy into their lives.
    * Sponsored, streamed gaming marathons are often held to raise money and awareness.
    * More details at meeting!
